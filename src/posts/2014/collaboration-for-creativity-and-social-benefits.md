_NOTE: This is heavily inspired by the phenomenal paper ['The Extended Mind' by Andy Clark and David J. Chamler](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html)._

Although I am feeling that I really do not need to bring more justifications on the table regarding why collaboration is beneficial for higher creativity, this is the thought that I just could not pass by.

### Active Externalism

Brain Storming is generally accepted as a standard procedure for people to create ideas together. It is proven to be efficient by cramping active engagement and extensive exploration in a short period of time. But how and why? While I was in search of the answer, I was impressed by the notion of _active externalism_ that was introduced in the paper.

> One can explain my choice of words in Scrabble, for example, as the outcome of an extended cognitive process involving the rearrangement of tiles on my tray. ... __In a very real sense, the re-arrangement of tiles on the tray is not part of action; it is part of thought.__

Even though the authors do not see it in a social context, the setting of Scabble is inherently social. You are rearranging tiles and other players can see your thinking. As described in the text above, here the boundary between your internal thinking and the re-arrangement on your fingertips becomes ambiguous. In addition, whatever you do - presenting your choice of word or arranging tiles back and forth - your action instantly affects other player's next move.

In my opinion, this effect is closely related to so-called _thinking out loud._ You are actively exposing your ideas to the public workspace and they directly influence other collaborators. It creates an organic network of instant feedback and rapid iteration. You are pulling the wire of creativity from your brain and connecting it to the network.

<!-- I see this kind of collaboration as raw and pure. It can only be happened at the same place and the same time. -->


### Collaboration in Social Context

> What about socially extended cognition? Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of other thinkers? We see no reason why not, in principle. ... In other social relationships these criteria may not be so clearly fulfilled, but they might nevertheless be fulfilled in specific domains. For example, the waiter at my favorite restaurant might act as a repository of my beliefs about my favorite meals (this might even be construed as a case of extended desire). In other cases, one's beliefs might be embodied in one's secretary, one's accountant, or one's collaborator.

Fortunately, the paper mentions the social aspect of active externalism. It lightens up the value of collaboration for higher creativity. I tilt this perspective into the music domain:

The other players in the workspace is now a part of your music making system. They inspire you in many ways: creating more ideas, intelligently modifying your materials, providing motives that you can expand and so on. Collaborators are a part of your tool. We seek problems (or ideas) together, solve them and generate more of them.

The first step, exposing yourself and becoming a part of system, is the most difficult obstacle to jump over. However, it will be such rewarding experience if you can overcome.
