In [the previous article](../classification-of-musical-collaboration-1), I argued the necessity of the time-sharing mechanism in the design of collaborative music system. It is simply capable of any variation between both ends, sequential and time-sharing methods. In this article, I will cover the other important aspect that the ideal system should have: __the separation between the private and public workspace.__

In most collaborative platforms, the transparency between users in a single session works in a simple way. Any one can observe what others do at any given moment. The following is the idea behind this simple policy:

> The complete transparency between collaborators promotes the group work.

This is generally acceptable for general purpose systems because the idea offers clear advantages: for developers, it is easy to design, realize and manage. It also is straightforward and effortless to users. Those systems mimic the characteristics of physical collaboration even including their shortcomings. When you work with other people in the same space, it is hard to hide your intention or action.

So let us rephrase it within the context of music making: is this true for collaborative creativity? 

In the process of music composition, there is a phase called ‘internalization’ or ‘germination’, which is the first step of creating musical motives or materials for later iteration and refinement. In the collaborative setting, one needs to create materials (such as riff or pattern) before presenting them to collaborators.

_Should we completely expose this step to the open table?_ Fencott and Bryan-Kinns claims otherwise. Their experiment with three simple prototypes suggests [The separation between private and public work space in the system seems to be useful, or rather necessary.](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-2990-5_11)

I am taking few more steps further from this research: the distinction between public and private workspaces is must-have, but the balance between them is a critical factor. To put it bluntly, the public space means the productivity and the private one connects to the creativity. 

<!-- If the balance is not right, the system might face overall failure: if the system is too open and public, the source materials will not be presented fast enough. If it is too closed and private, the collaboration will not happen as much as we want.
 -->
The system needs to guarantee the right amount of private work by prohibiting the over-achievement. It also required to promote the collaboration in the public workspace by pushing users to present materials as early as possible. The fine tuning of this factor will be a crucial point of the project.

The _timed-iteration_ seems to be an interesting idea. Presenting early, getting feedback, and moving on to the next iteration in a limited period of time - I believe it will accelerate the speed of network.

To summarize, I would like to suggest the following elements for the design of collaborative music making platform:
- Clear distinction between public and private workspaces
- Seamless transition and right balance between two spaces

...And more notes to come!
