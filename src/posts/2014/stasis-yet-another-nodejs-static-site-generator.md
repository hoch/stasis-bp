### Oh, Not Again!

Yeah. I hear you. We already have an army of static site generators that runs on Node.js. At the time of writing, [staticsitegenerators.net](http://staticsitegenerators.net/) indicates 48 static site generators are written and run on JavaScript.

When I found out that I had many solutions to try out, I didn't have a single clue that I am going to write one more site generator for Node.js. However, it quickly escalated when I placed the following roadblocks:

- It must be easy to use and maintain. No more "novel concepts."
- It must be using JavaScript.
- No exotic JS templating syntax.
- It must be using Mobile-first CSS and SASS preprocessor.
- Seamless development, rapid build procedure and customizable automation.

In short, my answers were:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Dust.js](http://linkedin.github.io/dustjs/) templating
- [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) with [Bower](http://bower.io/)

If I were to have all the features above, the closest solutions out of 48 contenders might be [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) or [DocPad](http://docpad.org/). Both projects are really powerful and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to build a site or blog. But here is a thing: both of them have a steep learning curve and too many features that I will not ever use.

[Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) was the project that I spent quite sometime on. I recommend it for its simplicity but keep it mind that you will have to get your hands dirty. I even dug into the source code and ended up with writing some plug-ins for it. Then I realized: I was writing too much code to achieve few simple things. Besides, npm already has tons of modules to execute my ideas.

So I said: _"Why don't I just write one?"_

And you are currently reading the page which is generated by __ Stasis__. The whole web site is generated by it. :) Just in case you're interested, here is the work-in-progress repo of [__Stasis__ on GitHub](https://github.com/hoch/stasis). Hopefully it will be up and running in few days, so I can publicize the project.


### A Journey Has Just Begun...

Actually creating a site generator with a bunch of npm modules was extremely fun. I was able to write one up in few days. (Few more days on refactoring and testing) If you dwell on the JS world and haven't done it before, I urge you to do it upcoming weekend. You will be amazed when you see there is no big difference between your pseudo code and the actual implementation. Oh, the power of npm.

I do not expect anyone out there will use __Stasis__ for the production. However, the effort will pay back soon enough for me. [WAAX](https://github.com/hoch/WAAX) project definitely needs some sort of documentation mechanism since I have been feeling [Beautiful Docs](https://github.com/maximebf/beautiful-docs) is a bit limited. Not only that, I always wanted to have a blog for my journal and trivia. 

__Stasis__ got them covered for sure!
