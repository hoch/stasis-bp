As my weekend project, I have been writing a framework based on the soon-to-be-public API for Chrome/Safari/Mozilla. (I don’t even know it does make sense or not - a framework as hobby?)

I knew writing a framework would be an invisible black hole that sucks up lots of time and energy without having short-term results. I created 4 git repos over 4 months - because I had to write it up from the scratch four times. Whenever I find flaws in the structure or discover new techniques that I can apply for the framework, I threw the whole thing away and started over without second thoughts.

In the mean time, other people opened GitHub repos with the similar ideas I had for this framework making me guilty commit by commit - but that guilty has been a driving force of my project. It was interesting dynamics. Although I have never met them and I doubt that they are not aware of my existence, I could read their ideas and reasonings though the code. Some are amazing and eye-opening - the other made me more confident and move forward.

So that was my story of building a framework.

However, I had an interesting thought about designing a framework. Throughout the whole coding/design process, I found myself writing tedious routines to make its users’ life easier. The major portion of work was more of connecting dots rather than ingenious hacking. To put it bluntly, jotting down a constructor and setter/getter is sort of easier than the homework of intermediate CS class. In the smaller scale, writing a framework can be a series of simple tasks. On the other hand, the homework has no “broad perspective” at all.

Suddenly [this quote][1] poped up in my head:

> “Humanities majors may well learn a great deal about the world. But they don’t really learn career skills through their studies. Engineering majors, conversely, learn in great technical detail. But they might not learn why, how, or where they should apply their skills in the workforce.”

Majoring humanity & science could be helpful in creating a framework. In my belief, it is more of “why and how” questions in its design and conceptualization process, which is the major portion of work on it.
