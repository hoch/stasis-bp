When using specialized environments for audio programing, there is a fair price to pay. You have to put on _a funny hat_ they offer: you embrace the novel (or unnecessarily unfamiliar) paradigm the platform imposes on you. Although things you can achieve are quite marvelous once you pay the price, it does not change the fact that the price is not so small.

The problem does not end here; the odds against audiences having these software on their machine are very high. This makes propagating one's work inconvenient defeating the ultimate cause of creation: sharing. The author must put effort in translating the work into the form can be consumed by common audiences and this process sometimes ends up carving essential parts out of the original intention or design.

The other interesting finding is most of them are designed by the bottom-up approach: a huge collection of countless tiny pieces such as oscillators, sample buffers, and filters. It is more like a mountain, not an elegant castle and you do not argue with the design of mountain usually. I doubt that there was a consideration of _need finding_ or _solid use cases_ during its implementation.

Due to this design approach, none of environments are user-centric or user-friendly; zero consideration on user experience. This formidable nature made some clever folks feel proud of themselves while other users turning their back to them. To conclude, my take on our beloved tools throughout the computer music history is **they are darn hard to learn.** So much pain, and not much of gain that you can actually share with other people.

I believe programming audio can be fun and practical. Its design must be tackled with the top-down approach focusing on user experience. To finalize my rants, we need this paradigm shift yesterday.
