Just had a thought with my breakfast and coffees.

When you regret something, it is a good thing in general. That means you have come to realize something important that you haven’t in the past.
Don’t say “you have no regret.” Regret your mistakes and learn from them. Bear those things in your mind for good.

If you’re saying you have no regret on something you have failed, it means either your defense mechanism is working to protect your ego (which is not really bad) or you just have no idea what you have done wrong. Your future mistakes lie in there.

The regret has two face. It is truly important not to throw your mind into the swamp of sorrows completely. This sharp blade will make you bleed to death whenever your guard is down.

Although I am arguing the regret is not a bad thing to do, do not enjoy the “self-criticizing.” You should regret so you can avoid possible wrong decisions in the future. If you start making it a pleasurable process, then you will find yourself becoming a sarcastic-been-there-done-that type of person. Your friends start blocking you on Facebook before long.

I do regret. All the time. That’s one of my expertise. I ingrain mistakes in my brain. Still, I am neither perfect nor satisfied with who I am today.
That’s why I am working hard, thinking hard and coding hard right now.
