While “a man of tongue” has became “a silent looser,” you get to experience the drastic change of perspective on almost everything. You will learn how to “suck it” and get used to being excluded socially. That was what happened to me for last 3 years in the States.

The first change I went through was returning back to a student from an articulate lecturer. The less proactive life as a student was not that bad. I could spend more time with my family - it was such beautiful experience that I should have had as a father and a husband. Also it was a great opportunity to rethink about my teaching philosophy and methodology. I couldn't help but to be completely receptive to a great academic experience at Stanford and that was the best thing ever happened to me.

Starting over from the clean slate - Believe me. It is a pure form of adversary. 3 years ago, 33 years of life at Korea didn't mean anything here. Every object immediately becomes hostile when you're an alien. I did my time in the ROK army - so I know what “the adversary” feels like. However, I would say starting a new life in a foreign country is ridiculously overwhelming than anything. I did my best to pass the storm with one hope in mind.

_“I don’t want to survive, I want to live.”_

After the trying time, many things happened. Mostly amazing things. I became a PhD candidate at CCRMA, did my fantastic internship at Google last summer and now I am expecting the second son who will be another life-changing event for me. One thing I can say for sure is that I couldn't do it alone. I have met wonderful people at Stanford and Google, and they changed my life, perspective and even my future.

Still, I often reminisce the things I left in Korea. My mentors, friends and family. It sometime feel awful because of the guilty that I am the only one who gets to enjoy the life at this wonderful community. I do not miss things in Korea in general, but I do miss my mentors and family.

I made that happened thanks to all the people who were there for me for last 3 years. I am terribly sorry that I couldn't make a chance to express my appreciation so far.

**Thank you!**
