__Hello, I am Hongchan.__

My career as a professional musician started at 2000 in South Korea, and my passion has grown to digital art and creative coding ever since. It led me to a wonderful journey at [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu) for the pursuit of PhD in music technology at __Stanford university__.

I deeply care about how people interact with music. With that in mind, I am always searching for new ways of composition and sound design. [WAAX and MUI](https://github.com/hoch/waax) are recent projects from such effort. From 2014 fall, I will be joining __Google Chrome__ to push the boundary of music production through the modern web technology.

I am living in Palo Alto with my beautiful wife and 2 hyper-energetic boys. I love [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hongchan/) and hand-drip coffee.
